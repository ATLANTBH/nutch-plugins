		<description>Regular expression naming plugin directory names to
		  include.  Any plugin not matching this expression is excluded.
		  In any case you need at least include the nutch-extensionpoints plugin. By
		  default Nutch includes crawling just HTML and plain text via HTTP,
		  and basic indexing and search plugins. In order to use HTTPS please enable 
		  protocol-httpclient, but be aware of possible intermittent problems with the 
		  underlying commons-httpclient library.
